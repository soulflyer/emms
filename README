This fork adds the ability to view playcounts, tracked by mpdev in
an sqlite database. It is unlikely to work out of the box, the
changes are only designed to work with my machines and are not
robust, or good code. Use at your own risk :-)

Emms is the Emacs Multimedia System. Emms displays and plays
multimedia from within GNU/Emacs using a variety of external players
and from different sources.

Emms can run as a minimalist player and controlled with a handful of
M-x Emacs commands, or a fully-fledged, interactive media
browser. Emms can display album art, play streaming audio, tag music
files, search for lyrics, provide MPD connectivity, control the
volume, and more.

Please read the info fine manual which is shipped with Emms and
available in the doc directory. We do our best to make sure that it's
up to date and informative.
